If you enable this module, then fatal errors (like invalid memory reads) will trap into the gdbstub. This uses UART0 to talk to GDB. If this happens while the UART0 is connected to a terminal (or some IDE like esplorer) then you will see a string starting with `$T` and a few more characters after that. This is the signal that a trap has happened, and control should be passed to gdb.</div> |

| rtcfifo | supported | - | - | <div style='font-size: 0.8em'>The rtcfifo module implements a first-in,first-out storage intended for sensor readings. As the name suggests, it is backed by the [RTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_clock) user memory and as such survives deep sleep cycles. Conceptually it can be thought of as a cyclic array of `{ timestamp, name, value }` tuples. Internally it uses a space-optimized storage format to allow the greatest number of samples to be kept. This comes with several trade-offs, and as such is not a one-solution-fits-all. Notably:</div> |

This can be used to significantly extend battery life on battery powered sensor nodes, as it is no longer necessary to fire up the RF module each wake-up in order to obtain an accurate timestamp.</div> |
